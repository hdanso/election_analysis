## How to read a file in Python:
## 1. Import os and csv modules
import os
import csv

## 2. Assign a variable for the file to load and the path
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources","election_results.csv")

## 3. Open the election results and read the file
    ## can use election_data = open(file_to_load, 'r') or can use the 'with' statements - with open(filename) as file_variable:
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:

## 4. Read the file object with the reader function (assign variable file_reader to file object)
    file_reader = csv.reader(election_data)

## 5. Iterate thru the variable (i.e. file_reader in this case) and print each row incl headers or column names
for row in file_reader:
    print(row)

## How to write a file in Python:
## 1. Import os and csv modules
import os
import csv

## 2. Create a filename variable to a direct or indirect path to the file.
file_to_save = os.path.join("analysis", "election_analysis.txt")

## 3. Using the with statement open the file as a text file.
    ## can use open(file_to_save, "w") or can use the 'with'statement (similar to reading files): 
with open(file_to_save, "w") as txt_file:

    # Write some data to the file.
    txt_file.write("Hello World")

    ## Can continue to add data to the file using the write() function
    txt_file.write("Arapahoe, Denver, Jefferson")

    ## Can also write items on a new line by using newline escpae sequence \n
    txt_file.write("Arapahoe\nDenver\nJefferson")

    ## (Optional) if using open() method instead of 'with' statement, close the file
    txt_file.close
