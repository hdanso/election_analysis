# An Analysis of Congressional Election Results

## Project Overview
Working with the Colorado board of elections team, the initial task was to complete an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. Tasks completed during the election audit included reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. 

### Resources
Resources used during this analysis include the following:
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 

### Project Summary
After completing the election audit, the results concluded that a total of 369,711 votes were casted during this election. There were a total of 3 candidates in the election, a breakdown of the name of each candidate, the total number of votes each candidate received, and the percentage of votes for each candidate is as follows:

- Charles Casper Stockham: received 85,213 total votes and 23.0% of the votes.
- Diana DeGette: received 272,892 total votes and 73.8% of the votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane: received 11,606 total votes and 3.1% of the votes.

Based on these results, the winner of the election based on popular vote was Diana DeGette, who received 272,892 total votes and 73.8% of the votes.

## Challenge Overview
Taking this analysis one step further, a report of the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout was completed. The overall purpose of this project was to use Python, a popular programming language, to automate the election audit and retrieve the reporting requirements to certify the local congressional election and complete the audit.
